Whereas data written to a blockchain is meant to be forever.. The solbots.io project aims to facilitate the need for temporary, encrypted, off-chain data storage through a high speed data layer of the Cryptoverse we call the Metasphere. Where encrypted data is meant to be accessed and changed frequently.  Inspired by Blockchain technology and in the spirit of the Cryptoverse, our network does not use traditional data storage systems like sql/mysql. Instead, we're developing a powerful file storage &amp; encryption platform that we've dedicated to the Cryptoverse and it's many growing technologies.

Solbots are Solana based NFT's, of which there are two types:

# Prime Bots

<strong>Design:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These bots are uniquely named and designed as comedic robot parodies.

<strong>Licensing:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Prime Bots can be collected, traded, transferred, or resold.
