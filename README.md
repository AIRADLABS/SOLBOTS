Whereas data written to a blockchain is not meant to be changed..  The solbots.io project aims to facilitate the need for temporary, encrypted, off-chain data storage through a high speed data layer of the Cryptoverse we call the Metasphere. Where encrypted data is meant to be accessed and changed frequently.  Inspired by Blockchain technology and in the spirit of the Cryptoverse, our network does not use traditional data storage systems like sql/mysql. Instead, we're developing a powerful file storage &amp; encryption platform that we've dedicated to the Cryptoverse and it's many growing technologies.

Solbots are Solana based NFT's, of which there are two types:

# Boss Bots

<strong>Design:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These bots are uniquely named and designed as comedic robot parodies.

<strong>Licensing:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The first collection of Solbots to leave the factory will be Boss Bots. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Boss Bots can be collected, traded, transferred, or resold.

<strong>Purpose:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These bots govern by allowing the bot owner the right to vote on community driven changes to the Metasphere. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Every Boss Bot you own can cast one vote.

# Worker Bots

<strong>Design:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These bots will be generated randomly from layers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; They will also have first and last name combinations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; They are randomly chosen from a large database of popular first and last names by region.

<strong>Licensing:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Worker bots can be collected. However, they can NOT be traded, transferred, or resold at this time.

<strong>Purpose:</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These bots serve as a <strong><i>proof of ownership</i></strong> of a Solbot Pod.
